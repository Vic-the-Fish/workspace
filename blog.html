				<p>this is going to be a very sad blog so hold on to your feelings.</p>
				<br>
				<p>about a year ago, i was in my bedroom contemplating where my life was going. the future seemed so daunting, so scary.</p>
				<br>
				<p>i was entering 10th grade.</p>
				<br>
				<p>i was worried about the incoming school year. this was my third to last year of my k-12 education. it had gone by so, so fast. it felt like only 2 years ago, i was entering 8th grade. i had built up so much excitement for 8th grade, which was all crushed by some weird principal who yelled at kids for asking questions and got mad at me for a youtube comment, which, to be fair, was pretty mean.</p>
				<br>
				<p>but enough with that. :)))))</p>
				<br>
				<p>today, i have come to the realization that life goes by very fast, like a multiple day car ride going to somewhere pretty far away that you'll know you'll get to eventually, but along the way you're worried that some stupid guy is gonna t-bone ur car and kill you. something like that.</p>
				<br>
				<p>the average human life span is 84 years according to a CNN survey of about 2,000 people. doing the math, since i am now 16 i am over a sixth of the way through my life. it feels like yesterday that i was playing with abc blocks, probably because i was. we need to be more aware of our life, and be more thankful for the things we might have such as money, shelter, food, and politicians.</p>
