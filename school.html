				<p>school is lame. school hurt my little brain. uhhhhhh</p>
				<br>
				<p>ima drop out and uhhhhhhhh</p>
				<br>
				<p>be real cool, yeah</p>	
				<br>
				<hr>
				<br>
				<p>those are the words of wisdom from the depths of my heart in my newest album, "screw sckhool." see, when i was a young boy, i decided that music was my calling. music is very mesmorizing, every note executed perfectly to draw you in, touching your very soul. but how does this relate to school? it doesn't. i just wanted to plug my album, screw you.</p>
				<br>
				<hr>
				<br>
				<p>school is one of those things i know i need, and i enjoy a lot, but if there's one thing i really hate it's the school starting time. who thought it was a good idea to have teenagers be forced to wake up early? i think i heard my teacher say "teenagers naturally hate waking up early," and as we all know what the teacher says is law. my biggest fear in the whole world is falling asleep in class to have some angry teacher smack my desk with a yardstick; i have night terrors about that happening every day.<p>
				<br>
				<p>speaking of which, screw planners. i see the point in them, sure they help you organize your week. but if you don't have like 4 entries, thats a big bad and you're gonna be sent to your AP and arrested, etc.</p>
